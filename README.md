# About
A straightforward NextJS application that retrieves a 30-second song preview URL using a Spotify track ID.

The main logic can be found in the **fetch-spotify-preview-url.tsx**

# Roadmap
In the future, I'd like to tweak the UI which is quite generic and simple.

I'd also like to turn this into a usable package (for now, I have no idea how to do so)

I could also add compatibility to input a whole array of IDs instead of a single one

# Credits
This is heavily based on [lakshay007's spotify-preview-finder](https://github.com/lakshay007/spot).
I changed the logic around, as his version required searching using the song title which I thought could have a huge margin of error.
However, I'm giving him all the credits for the scraping logic.
